Words from Harry:

> Okay the in game instructions are SUPER non-informative. Hopefully this document will remedy some of the problems.. provided that you read and understand this.

> This is a 2 human player, 1v1 game.

> One player plays the role of the DIGGER, who needs to find his way to the level's exit.

> 1. You may control his movment with the WASD keys.

> 2. If you press SPACE, he will use one of his five flares. Flares kill DARK ONEs that are nearby. Use a flare when you think the second player is close by.
> 	 Note: DARK ONEs are normally harmless and do not kill you, UNLESS the one that touches you is possessed by player two.

> 3. There are sometimes tiles that hinder your path to the exit. You may dig these tiles simply by walking against the tiles until they break. 

> If you do not apply enough pressure (hold the key long enough) they will not break. Certain tiles may not be broken. These tiles are grey.

> The second player plays an evil being, called the DARK ONE that is trying to kill the DIGGER. On each level, there are various DARK ONE ais that walk around. 

> 1. Press P to possess one of the DARK ONEs on the screen. If there are no DARK ONES nearby, you must wait.

> 2. Move around with the ARROW keys.

> 3. Once you have possessed one of the DARK ONEs you must figure out which is your character on screen. You must do this subtly, as to not give away to player one who you are.
> 	 Various actions you can do to figure this out: Move around a bit; Press J, K, or L to do an action. Ais will do these actions too from time to time, but this should help identify who you are. 
> 	 These actions do not affect the game in any way

> 4. Kill player 1 by walking over him. If he pulls out a flare and you are caught by its blast, you die, so you must find the right moment to strike, or make him waste flares until he runs out.

> I understand this game is actually quite hard to understand at first, and the levels are a bit daunting at first. But this is an interesting game for us. 
> The concept is exciting, and the games are repeatable and unpredictable yet require skill. There are certain areas that require polishing and possibly upgrading,
> but most likely we will leave it at this.

> Sincerely, 

>	The Dreamy Cactus team
